ML-Project-on-Credit-Loans is a fun personal project to practice using predictive models in business scenarios. This project compares machine learning methods like decision trees and the naive Bayes classifier in order to find a model that accurately predicts whether a customer should receive a loan, based on the probability that they will not default.
